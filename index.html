            <li class="boom">Milestone 1: Non-Mechanical Devices
                <p>The <i>abacus</i> was the first "calculator". It was a frame with a series of rods on it, each rod holding ten beads. when one row had all the beads moved to the side, then you would move to the next row. The <i>abacus</i> made addition and subtraction easier and reduced errors. The <i>abacus</i> also might have led to the term 'beam counters' for accountans later. The <i>abacus</i> was used first by Sumerians and Egyptians around 2000 B.C. Closer to the 17th century, logarithms developed by John Napier led to the creation of the <i>slide rule</i> by Edward Gunter and William Oughtred. The <i>slide rule</i> was a disc with a stick that would rotate and give the answers to logarthmic problems. The <i>slide rule</i> made multipulcation and division problems easier and quicker to solve.</p>

            <li class: "pow">Milestone 2: The First Mechanical Calculators</li>
                <p>The first mechanical calculator did not have a name but it was invented by Blaise Pascal in 1642. His goal was to build 'a device that will eventually perform all four arithmetic operations without relying on human intelligence.' Later, Gottfried Leibniz attempted to create a better version of that using a 'Leibniz wheel,' but eventually failed to at the end of his life. In 1820 Thomas de Colmar made and patented the <i>Arithmometer</i>. It was the first commercially available counting machine. eventually hand cranked counting machines were developed like the <i>Grant Mechanical Calculating Machine</i> in 1877 and the <i> P100 Burroughs Adding Machine</i> in 1886 by William Seward Burroughs.</p>

            <li class="boom">Milestone 3: Electronic Calculators</li>
                <p>Starting in the 1930's, many electronic calculators became a new ammenity in businesses, especially during the Second World War. In 1946, the worlds first general calculating computer was constructed. The <i>ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer)</i> was originally created to be a completely digital artillery firing table calculator. it was also able to do a large class of numerical problems in addition to the four basic arithmetical functions. The <i>ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer)</i> was 1000 times faster than other calculators. it requies 1800 sqft of floorspace and also weighed 20 tons.</p>

            <li class: "pow">Milestone 4: Valve and Tube Calculators</li>
                <p>The world's first all electronic desktop calculator was the <i>ANITA (A New Inspiration To Arithmetic/Accounting)</i> The <i>ANITA (A New Inspiration To Arithmetic/Accounting)</i> was developed in Britain by Control Systems Ltd. The only moving parts on it was the layout of the keys. Everything else was electronic. being the only electronic desktop calculator the <i>ANITA</i> sold tens of thousands of products around the world until 1964</p>

            <li class="boom">Milestone 5: Transistor Age Calculators</li>
                <p>During the Beatles era, many calculators became more available. Starting with the <i>Toscal BC-1411 calculator</i> made by Toshiba. This calculator was one of the first to utilize RAM (Random Access Memory) The <i>Olivetti Programma 101</i> was a great calculator thst won many awards in industrial design. People also considered it to be the first personal computer. The <i>ELKA 22</i> designed by Bulgaria's Central Institute for Calculation Technologies was the first calculatorto include the square root function. In 1967, Texas Intsruments created the <i>Cal Tech</i> and it was compact enough to fit into your hand. </p>
