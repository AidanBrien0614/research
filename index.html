        <p>5 milestones</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Milestone 1: Non-Mechanical Devices
                <p>The <i>abacus</i> was the first "calculator". It was a frame with a series of rods on it, each rod holding ten beads. when one row had all the beads moved to the side, then you would move to the next row. The <i>abacus</i> made addition and subtraction easier and reduced errors. The <i>abacus</i> also might have led to the term 'beam counters' for accountans later. The <i>abacus</i> was used first by Sumerians and Egyptians around 2000 B.C. Closer to the 17th century, logarithms developed by John Napier led to the creation of the <i>slide rule</i> by Edward Gunter and William Oughtred. The <i>slide rule</i> was a disc with a stick that would rotate and give the answers to logarthmic problems. The <i>slide rule</i> made multipulcation and division problems easier and quicker to solve.</p>

            <li>Milestone 2: The First Mechanical Calculators</li>
                <p>The first mechanical calculator did not have a name but it was invented by Blaise Pascal in 1642. His goal was to build 'a device that will eventually perform all four arithmetic operations without relying on human intelligence.' Later, Gottfried Leibniz attempted to create a better version of that using a 'Leibniz wheel,' but eventually failed to at the end of his life. In 1820 Thomas de Colmar made and patented the <i>Arithmometer</i>. It was the first commercially available counting machine. eventually hand cranked counting machines were developed like the <i>Grant Mechanical Calculating Machine</i> in 1877 and the <i> P100 Burroughs Adding Machine</i> in 1886 by William Seward Burroughs.</p>
